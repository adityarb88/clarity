These alerts are for notifying users that a particular component or area of the screen needs attention. Standard alerts have four levels, denoted by color and icon. From most to least severe, they are:</p>\\n\\n        <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n            <li>Error–a problem needs fixing</li>\\n            <li>Warning–an action might have a harmful outcome</li>\\n            <li>Info–a situation needs attention, at some point</li>\\n            <li>Success–a significant achievement occurred</li>\\n        </ul>\\n\\n        <p>Other choices for displaying messages are <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/input-fields\\\">input field validations</a> and <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/modals\\\">modals</a> . However, these components require users to take action before proceeding.</p>\\n\\n        <h3 id=\\\"placement-and-size\\\">Placement and Size</h3>\\n\\n        <p>Alert positioning should be contextual to the component or area to which it applies. For example, if the alert applies to the entire content area, place it at the top and span the width of that area.</p>\\n\\n        <p>Base the height of the alert (36 or 24 pixels) on its location. The larger alert is for use in the application’s main content area, modals, and wizards. The smaller alert is for use in cards.</p>\\n\\n        <h3 id=\\\"closing-alerts\\\">Closing Alerts</h3>\\n\\n        <p>A close button (X) serves as a method for users to acknowledge the alert. It also allows users to declutter the view. Omit the close button if the alert should be persistent.</p>\\n\\n        <h3 id=\\\"message-text\\\">Message Text</h3>\\n\\n        <p>Keep the message text short and concise. If combining multiple messages in a single alert, make sure that the messages are of the same type. Avoid mixing error and warning messages.</p>\\n\\n        <h3 id=\\\"stacking-alerts\\\">Stacking Alerts</h3>\\n\\n        <p>When showing multiple alerts, stack from most severe to least severe:</p>\\n\\n        <ol class=\\\"list\\\">\\n            <li>Error</li>\\n            <li>Warning</li>\\n            <li>Info</li>\\n            <li>Success</li>\\n        </ol>\\n\\n        <p>Stack up to three alerts. For more than three, consider an alternate pattern, such as displaying the information on another page.</p>\\n\\n        <h3 id=\\\"actions\\\">Actions</h3>\\n\\n        <p>You can display up to two actions in an alert. For more than two actions, use a dropdown menu, limiting the number of items to five.</p>\\n\\n        <p>The most common course of action goes at the top of the menu, destructive actions at the bottom. Avoid placing destructive actions directly in the alert.</p>\\n\\n        <p>Actions in standard alerts are represented by links because links take up less space than buttons and are light in appearance.\\n            <!-- One line is 36 pixels tall using links.  With flat buttons, the line is taller to accommodate the button state change. -->\\n        </p>\\n\\n        <h3 id=\\\"color\\\">Color</h3>\\n\\n        <p>Alerts have their own color palette of red, yellow, green, and blue. They are not styled with Stoplight colors to avoid competition with call-to-action buttons.</p>\\n\\n        <h2 id=\\\"using-app-level-alerts\\\">Using App-Level Alerts</h2>\\n\\n        <p>An app-level alert appears at the top of the screen, above the application header. This alert is reserved for a single, system-level message.</p>\\n\\n        <p>App-level alerts have three severity levels:</p>\\n\\n        <table class=\\\"table .table-noborder \\\">\\n            <tr>\\n                <th class=\\\"left\\\">Type</th>\\n                <th class=\\\"left\\\">Example</th>\\n            </tr>\\n            <tr>\\n                <td class=\\\"left\\\">Error</td>\\n                <td class=\\\"left\\\">A problem exists with a server</td>\\n            </tr>\\n            <tr>\\n                <td class=\\\"left\\\">Warning</td>\\n                <td class=\\\"left\\\">A license is about to expire</td>\\n            </tr>\\n            <tr>\\n                <td valign=\\\"top\\\" class=\\\"left\\\">Info</td>\\n                <td class=\\\"left\\\"> A trial is about to end<br /> Support is required for a feature </td>\\n            </tr>\\n        </table>\\n\\n        <h3 id=\\\"guidelines\\\">Guidelines</h3>\\n\\n        <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n            <li>Show only one app-level alert at a time.</li>\\n            <li>Keep the message text to one line–don’t wrap the text.</li>\\n            <li>Include up to two actions and keep button labels concise.</li>\\n            <li>Do not include a menu within the alert.</li>\\n            <li>When appropriate, include a close icon so that the app-level alert can be dismissed.</li>\\n        </ul>\\n    </article>\\n</clr-doc-wrapper>\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/app/documentation/demos/alert/alerts.demo.html\n// module id = 678\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"<!--\\n  ~ Copyright (c) 2016 - 2017 VMware, Inc.

This is sometimes called a master-detail\\n    or master-child pattern. On of the solutions we provide for this pattern is expandable rows in the datagrid.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    To make a row expandable, you need to put a <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-dg-row-detail&gt;</code>\\n    component inside your row, and add a <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">*clrIfExpanded</code> structural directive on it.\\n    This directive doesn't take any input, it is here for 2 reasons: make sure the details are only instantiated once\\n    they are needed, and make it very clear in <em>your</em> application templates that this part\\n    of the DOM is not present at all times, but only when the row is expanded.\\n    This component can contain anything: text, images, graphs, ... It can ignore the overall table layout.\\n    If you wish to display details for each cell of the row individually and respect the table layout,\\n    all you need to do is use our usual <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-dg-cell&gt;</code> component in the detail.\\n    Make sure you have exactly as many cells in the detail as you have in the row, or they will not align properly.\\n</p>\\n\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.basic\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"html\\\"></clr-example>\\n\\n<p>\\n    If you want the details to replace the original row rather than expand under it, we offer a\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">[clrDgReplace]</code> input that receives a boolean on the\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-dg-row-detail&gt;</code> component. In other words, to make details replace the row\\n    they're in, just write:\\n</p>\\n\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.replace\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"html\\\"></clr-example>\\n\\n<p>\\n    Finally, you might need to make a server call to get the details for a row before you can display them.\\n    This is a very common lazy loading pattern. In this case, you need to add a\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">[clrLoading]</code> directive receiving a boolean <em>anywhere in the row</em>.\\n    Yes, it can be absolutely anywhere, as long as it's in or on the row itself.\\n    The easiest way to make the server call lazily is simply to create a component that will make the call on\\n    initialization (typically in the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">ngOnInit()</code> method), and to use that component\\n    inside the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">*clrIfExpanded</code> structural directive. Here is an example of what this\\n    solution typically looks like.\\n</p>\\n\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.lazyLoadingRow\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"html\\\"></clr-example>\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.lazyLoadingDetail\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"typescript\\\"></clr-example>\\n\\n<div class=\\\"alert alert-info\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"alert-item\\\">\\n        <span class=\\\"alert-text\\\">\\n            Note the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">ngProjectAs</code> attribute on our custom detail component.\\n            This is needed to make sure it is projected in the same place an actual\\n            <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-dg-row-detail&gt;</code> would be.\\n        </span>\\n    </div>\\n</div>\\n\\n<p>\\n    Here is an example showcasing all these different combinations in action:\\n</p>\\n\\n<form>\\n    <div class=\\\"form-group\\\">\\n        <label>Type of detail</label>\\n        <div class=\\\"radio-inline\\\">\\n            <input type=\\\"radio\\\" name=\\\"detail\\\" id=\\\"detail-default\\\" value=\\\"default\\\" [(ngModel)]=\\\"detail\\\">\\n            <label for=\\\"detail-default\\\">Overall</label>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\\\"radio-inline\\\">\\n            <input type=\\\"radio\\\" name=\\\"detail\\\" id=\\\"detail-columns\\\" value=\\\"columns\\\" [(ngModel)]=\\\"detail\\\">\\n            <label for=\\\"detail-columns\\\">Per column</label>\\n        </div>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\\\"form-group\\\">\\n        <div class=\\\"checkbox-inline\\\">\\n            <input type=\\\"checkbox\\\" name=\\\"replace\\\" id=\\\"replace\\\" [(ngModel)]=\\\"replace\\\">\\n            <label for=\\\"replace\\\">Replace row</label>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\\\"checkbox-inline\\\">\\n            <input type=\\\"checkbox\\\" name=\\\"slow-load\\\" id=\\\"slow-load\\\" [(ngModel)]=\\\"slowLoad\\\">\\n            <label for=\\\"slow-load\\\">Lazy loading</label>\\n        </div>\\n    </div>\\n</form>\\n\\n<clr-datagrid>\\n    <clr-dg-column>User ID</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'name'\\\">Name</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'creation'\\\">Creation date</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'pokemon.name'\\\">Pokemon</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'color'\\\">Favorite color</clr-dg-column>\\n\\n    <clr-dg-row *clrDgItems=\\\"let user of users\\\" [clrDgItem]=\\\"user\\\">\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.id}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.name}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.creation | date}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.pokemon.name}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>\\n            <span class=\\\"color-square\\\" [style.backgroundColor]=\\\"user.color\\\"></span>\\n        </clr-dg-cell>\\n\\n        <clr-dg-row-detail *clrIfExpanded [clrDgReplace]=\\\"replace\\\">\\n            <ng-template [clrFakeLoader]=\\\"slowLoad\\\" clrLoading>\\n                <ng-container *ngIf=\\\"detail === 'default'\\\">\\n                    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

When this is the case you can write your own filter, with fully\\n    custom template and controller, and both wrap it in and pass it to a\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-dg-filter&gt;</code> component in your column declaration.\\n    This can be done whether or not your column is declared as a\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrDgField</code>, and will always take precedence over it if it is.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The filter you provide to the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-dg-filter&gt;</code> component\\n    needs to implement the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">Filter</code> interface provided by Clarity:\\n</p>\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.filterInterface\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"typescript\\\"></clr-example>\\n\\n<p>\\n    There are several ways to pass your filter to the\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-dg-filter&gt;</code> component:\\n</p>\\n<ul>\\n    <li>\\n        The simplest, but less reusable way, is to simply inline your filter's template in the\\n        column and use the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">[clrDgFilter]</code> input to pass your filter\\n        instance:\\n        <clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.inlineFilterTS\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"typescript\\\"></clr-example>\\n        <clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.inlineFilterHTML\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"html\\\"></clr-example>\\n    </li>\\n    <li>\\n        A more reusable way is to write an actual component for your custom filter,\\n        and inject its <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">DatagridFilter</code> parent in its constructor so\\n        that it can register itself:\\n        <clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.customFilterComponentTS\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"typescript\\\"></clr-example>\\n        <clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.customFilterComponentHTML\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"html\\\"></clr-example>\\n    </li>\\n    <li>\\n        Finally, if you want to have a completely reusable filter independently of our Datagrid,\\n        you can write a component for it and use a template reference variable to declare the\\n        filter to its container:\\n        <clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.templateVariableTS\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"typescript\\\"></clr-example>\\n        <clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.templateVariableHTML\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"html\\\"></clr-example>\\n    </li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>\\n    In our example, we can create \\\"color picker\\\" filter, rather than have to search by color

All Rights Reserved.\\n  ~ This software is released under MIT license.\\n  ~ The full license information can be found in LICENSE in the root directory of this project.\\n  -->\\n\\n<h2>Server-driven datagrid</h2>\\n\\n<p>\\n    When dealing with large amounts of data or heavy processing, a datagrid often has access the\\n    currently displayed data only, requesting only the necessary pieces from the server. This is a\\n    very common case that we fully support.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    We expose events and hooks on all parts of the datagrid to make sure you can trigger any\\n    requests you need based on precise user actions. But an important thing to note is that when\\n    the server does handle pagination, it needs to also deal with sorting and filtering,\\n    because all three are tightly coupled. In light of this, we decided to expose a single global\\n    output <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">(clrDgRefresh)</code> that emits the current \\\"state\\\" of the\\n    datagrid whenever it changes due to a user action or an external one. This state has the\\n    following format:\\n</p>\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.stateInterface\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"typescript\\\"></clr-example>\\n<p>\\n    It contains all the information you need to send to the server in order to get the slice of\\n    data currently displayed. It even contains redundant information (\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">page.to</code> and <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">page.size</code> for instance),\\n    to make sure you have access to the most practical for you without extra processing.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    One important thing to note is that since you don't have all the data available at once, you\\n    cannot use the smart iterator\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">*clrDgItems</code>: it would sort, filter and paginate a subset of the\\n    data that has already gone through all that. So all you need to do is to go back to a simple\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">*ngFor</code>, which we support.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Finally, since server calls are involved, we need some way of notifying the user that his\\n    action has been acknowledged and that we are currently working on it. To this effect, we\\n    provide an input <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">[clrDgLoading]</code> that you can use to display the\\n    datagrid in a loading state, while fetching data.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\n    Here is an example showcasing all this with a fake server latency of 500ms.

Sometimes, a column is not even a property on your\\n    model but is dynamically generated instead. In these cases, you might want to specify a custom comparator to sort the\\n    column according to your needs. This can be done by providing a comparator through the\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">[clrDgSortBy]</code> input, whether or not your column is declared as a\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrDgField</code>, and will always take precedence over it if it is.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    A comparator is just an object that implements a <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">compare</code> method that could be given as\\n    parameter to Javascript's native\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">Array.sort()</code> function. In other words, if a and b are two elements being compared, then:\\n</p>\\n<ul>\\n    <li>\\n        if compare(a, b) is less than 0, a comes first,\\n    </li>\\n    <li>\\n        if compare(a, b) returns 0, leave a and b unchanged with respect to each other, but sorted with respect to all other items,\\n    </li>\\n    <li>\\n        if compare(a, b) is greater than 0, b comes first.\\n    </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>\\n    The safest way to check that your types comply with our API is to have your comparator be an instance of a class that implement\\n    the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">Comparator</code> interface provided by Clarity.\\n</p>\\n<div class=\\\"alert alert-info\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"alert-item\\\">\\n        <span class=\\\"alert-text\\\">\\n            Why use an object instead of the function directly?\\n        </span>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\\\"alert-item\\\">\\n        <span>\\n            Using an object implementing an interface allows strong type-checking, which is safer\\n            for your application.

Often, these actions navigate to a new location. For example, you might have a Settings dropdown\\n            that changes context to provide\\n            logout, account settings, and so on.</p>\\n\\n        <p>Don’t confuse dropdowns with <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/select-boxes\\\">select boxes</a>, which also present\\n            a list of choices. Select boxes are for data input within forms whereas dropdowns are for navigating outside\\n            of the existing context.</p>\\n\\n        <h4 id=\\\"behavior\\\">Behavior</h4>\\n\\n        <p>Users open a dropdown by clicking its toggle. By default, selecting a menu item or clicking outside the menu\\n            dismisses the menu. You can change this behavior so that the menu remains open on item selection.</p>\\n\\n        <h4 id=\\\"placement\\\">Placement</h4>\\n\\n        <p>By default, a dropdown opens from the bottom of the toggle, along the left side. You can change the placement\\n            by using one of the eight direction classes.</p>\\n\\n        <h4 id=\\\"menu-toggle\\\">Menu Toggle</h4>\\n\\n        <p>Clarity recommends that you use a button for the toggle. The button can contain either text or an icon.</p>\\n\\n        <h4 id=\\\"menu-items\\\">Menu Items</h4>\\n\\n        <p>Order menu items by usage, except for destructive actions, which belong at the bottom. Keep the text short\\n            and concise. Long menu items are truncated from the end and an ellipsis added.</p>\\n\\n        <h4 id=\\\"disabled\\\">Disabled</h4>\\n\\n        <p>Disable a menu item if:</p>\\n\\n        <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n            <li>It can apply in a different context.</li>\\n            <li>The user doesn’t have permissions for the action.</li>\\n            <li>An appropriate object is not currently selected.</li>\\n        </ul>\\n    </article>\\n</clr-doc-wrapper>\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/app/documentation/demos/dropdown/dropdown.demo.html\n// module id = 765\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"<!--\\n  ~ Copyright (c) 2016 - 2017 VMware, Inc.

Forms are comprised of <a\\n                routerLink=\\\"/documentation/typography\\\">text</a> and input components such as <a\\n                routerLink=\\\"/documentation/checkboxes\\\">checkboxes</a>, <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/dropdowns\\\">dropdowns</a>,\\n            <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/input-fields\\\">input fields</a>, <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/radios\\\">radio\\n                buttons</a>, and <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/toggle-switches\\\">toggle switches</a>.</p>\\n\\n        <h4 id=\\\"minimize-scrolling\\\">Minimize Scrolling</h4>\\n\\n        <p>For a form that scrolls several pages, consider organizing the content by:</p>\\n\\n        <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n            <li>Grouping related fields in a form block with a descriptive label.</li>\\n            <li>Progressively revealing more complex or less frequently used data.</li>\\n            <li>Dividing content into separate pages in a <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/wizards\\\">wizard</a>.</li>\\n        </ul>\\n\\n        <h4 id=\\\"labels\\\">Labels</h4>\\n\\n        <p>Labels appear to the left of a component, moving above the component when the user resizes the window to\\n            smaller dimensions.</p>\\n\\n        <p>Labels use sentence case, and label headers use title case, with no ending punctuation.</p>\\n\\n        <h4 id=\\\"placeholder-text\\\">Placeholder Text</h4>\\n\\n        <p>Located inside a field, placeholder text can help clarify expected input. Placeholder text disappears when\\n            the user types in the field.</p>\\n\\n        <p>Tip: Use the label to show what information goes in the field and placeholder text as a hint, description, or\\n            example format:</p>\\n\\n        <p>Label: Airport\\n            <br/> Placeholder text: SFO, SJO</p>\\n\\n        <p>Placeholder text can replace labels only in simple forms with a few easily-understood fields, see the <a\\n                routerLink=\\\"/documentation/login\\\">login page</a>.</p>\\n\\n        <h4 id=\\\"disabled-fields\\\">Disabled Fields</h4>\\n\\n        <p>Show a disabled field only if the user can take a reasonable action to enable the component. When disabling a\\n            component, also disable all associated elements, such as the component label and explanatory text.</p>\\n\\n        <h4 id=\\\"button-placement\\\">Button Placement</h4>\\n\\n        <p>Button placement depends on form type and where it appears in the UI. See <a\\n                routerLink=\\\"/documentation/buttons\\\">buttons</a> for guidelines.</p>\\n\\n        <h4 id=\\\"validation\\\">Validation</h4>\\n\\n        <p>For information on validation, see <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/input-fields\\\">input fields</a>.</p>\\n\\n        <h4 id=\\\"focus-and-navigation\\\">Focus and Navigation</h4>\\n\\n        <p>Provide auto focus in the first field by default. Users can then navigate through the form in a logical\\n            sequence.</p>\\n    </article>\\n</clr-doc-wrapper>\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/app/documentation/demos/forms/forms.demo.html\n// module id = 771\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"<!--\\n  ~ Copyright (c) 2016 - 2017 VMware, Inc.

Some pages might benefit from a three-column layout, where\\n            other pages might work best with a two-column layout.</p>\\n\\n        <p>You can vary the column layout within the same page. This strategy works well for presenting content that\\n            scrolls vertically.</p>\\n\\n        <p>Don’t lock your design into a layout optimized for a large window.</p>\\n\\n        <h4 id=\\\"grids-and-card-layouts\\\">Grids and Card Layouts</h4>\\n\\n        <p>Designing to a grid is especially important for <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/cards\\\">card</a> layouts. Cards\\n            contains blocks of content and their height and width can vary. The grid aligns the cards in a way that is\\n            easy for users to navigate.</p>\\n\\n        <h4 id=\\\"if-you-decide-not-to-conform-to-the-grid\\\">If You Decide Not to Conform to the Grid</h4>\\n\\n        <p>Do so with intent. Find a balance between aesthetics and conformity. Keep in mind that elements that are not\\n            aligned to the grid draw attention in the same way as color, contrast, and iconography and require more\\n            cognitive effort on the part of the\\n            user.</p>\\n    </article>\\n</clr-doc-wrapper>\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/app/documentation/demos/grid/grid.demo.html\n// module id = 784\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"<!--\\n  ~ Copyright (c) 2016 - 2017 VMware, Inc.

icon\\n            with CSS</h6>\\n\\n        <p>\\n            After adding <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clr-icon</code> in your HTML, view it using a web inspection tool. You\\n            will find that SVG elements are injected inside the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clr-icon</code> tag that are\\n            responsible for drawing the icon.\\n        </p>\\n\\n        <p>\\n            You can individually select any of these SVG graphic elements and stylize them through CSS. For easier\\n            access to the individual graphic parts of the icon, each piece of the glyph has a unique number identifier.\\n            For example,\\n            <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.clr-i-outline-path-3</code> targets the third path in the outlined version of an\\n            icon.\\n        </p>\\n\\n        <p>\\n            There are also a couple of common CSS classes that can help you target common elements.\\n            <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.clr-i-badge</code> targets the round dot in badged icons. Likewise, <code\\n                class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.clr-i-alert</code> targets the yellow triangle in alerted icons. Both of these classes\\n            work across solid and outlined icons.\\n        </p>\\n\\n        <h3 id=\\\"clarity-icons-api\\\">Clarity Icons API</h3>\\n\\n        <p>\\n            Clarity Icons features a namespaced core of functionality that is publicly accessible off of the browser's\\n            <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">window</code> object. This \\\"API\\\" is available at\\n            <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">window.ClarityIcons</code> and provides two useful pieces of functionality.\\n        </p>\\n\\n        <h5>Adding custom icons to ClarityIcons</h5>\\n        <p>\\n            The ClarityIcons API enables you to add your own icons to the publically available ClarityIcons\\n            architecture. Use the following call to add your icon to our library in your application:\\n        </p>\\n        <pre><code clr-code-highlight=\\\"language-typescript\\\">\\nClarityIcons.add(&#123;\\\"shapeNameGoesHere\\\": &quot;&lt;svg ... &gt;[your SVG code goes here]&lt;/svg&gt;&quot;&#125;);\\n</code></pre>\\n        <p>\\n            This API method will assign your SVG markup to the named shape it is sent. The icon can then be retrieved\\n            like in your application like any other icon in the ClarityIcons library.\\n        </p>\\n        <pre><code clr-code-highlight=\\\"language-html\\\">\\n&lt;clr-icon shape=&quot;shapeNameGoesHere&quot;&gt;&lt;/clr-icon&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n        <h5>Creating custom aliases for ClarityIcons</h5>\\n        <p>\\n            The Clarity Icons API can create aliases for the icons in your application with a single API call:\\n        </p>\\n        <pre><code clr-code-highlight=\\\"language-typescript\\\">\\nClarityIcons.alias(&#123;\\\"bell\\\": [\\\"alarm\\\", \\\"oh-noehz\\\"]&#125;);\\n</code></pre>\\n        <p>\\n            The above method call will assign \\\"alarm\\\" and \\\"oh-noehz\\\" names to the existing \\\"bell\\\" icon shape. Now you\\n            can use the \\\"bell\\\" icon with any of the new names you have assigned it.\\n        </p>\\n        <pre><code clr-code-highlight=\\\"language-html\\\">\\n&lt;clr-icon shape=&quot;bell&quot;&gt;&lt;/clr-icon&gt;\\n&lt;clr-icon shape=&quot;alarm&quot;&gt;&lt;/clr-icon&gt;\\n&lt;clr-icon shape=&quot;oh-noehz&quot;&gt;&lt;/clr-icon&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n    </article>\\n</clr-doc-wrapper>\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/app/documentation/demos/iconography/icons.demo.html\n// module id = 796\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"<!--\\n  ~ Copyright (c) 2016 - 2017 VMware, Inc.

Use a stack view when you want to:</p>\\n\\n        <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n            <li>Display related key/value pairs, for example, an object’s settings.</li>\\n            <li>Progressively disclose data. This is useful when the set of key/value pairs is large or you want to\\n                enable users to reveal more complex or less frequently used data as necessary.\\n            </li>\\n        </ul>\\n\\n        <h4 id=\\\"enabling-value-editing\\\">Enabling Value Editing</h4>\\n\\n        <p>In this pattern, the component includes an Edit button on the top right, which on click opens an editable\\n            stack view in a modal. This design prevents users from accidentally altering a value in the main content\\n            area. Common editing controls include\\n            input fields, select boxes, checkboxes, and radio buttons.</p>\\n\\n        <h4 id=\\\"labels\\\">Labels</h4>\\n\\n        <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n            <li>Provide terse labels that let users know what is under the label. Try to keep the label to one line.\\n            </li>\\n            <li>Use noun phrases, sentence-style capitalization, and no ending punctuation.</li>\\n            <li>Avoid using icons.</li>\\n        </ul>\\n\\n        <h4 id=\\\"highlights-and-horizontal-lines\\\">Highlights and Horizontal lines</h4>\\n\\n        <p>The stack view highlight color (#DDDDDD) differs from the usual Clarity highlight color to make it more\\n            distinct. Expanded sections have a lighter background color to make it easier to parse the hierarchy.</p>\\n\\n        <p>Horizontal lines in the stack editor are for readability–they help users quickly discern the relationship\\n            between columns.</p>\\n    </article>\\n</clr-doc-wrapper>\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/app/documentation/demos/stack-view/stack-view.demo.html\n// module id = 866\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"<router-outlet></router-outlet>\\n<nav class=\\\"sidenav\\\" [clr-nav-level]=\\\"2\\\">\\n    <section class=\\\"sidenav-content\\\">\\n        <a class=\\\"nav-link\\\" routerLink=\\\"/documentation\\\" routerLinkActive=\\\"active\\\"\\n           [routerLinkActiveOptions]=\\\"{exact:true}\\\">Component Status</a>\\n\\n        <section class=\\\"nav-group collapsible\\\">\\n            <input id=\\\"tab2\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\">\\n            <label for=\\\"tab2\\\">Patterns</label>\\n            <ul class=\\\"nav-list\\\">\\n                <documentation-nav-links type=\\\"pattern\\\"></documentation-nav-links>\\n            </ul>\\n        </section>\\n        <section class=\\\"nav-group collapsible\\\">\\n            <input id=\\\"tab1\\\" type=\\\"checkbox\\\">\\n            <label for=\\\"tab1\\\">Components</label>\\n            <ul class=\\\"nav-list\\\">\\n                <documentation-nav-links type=\\\"component\\\"></documentation-nav-links>\\n            </ul>\\n        </section>\\n    </section>\\n</nav>\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/app/documentation/documentation.component.html\n// module id = 867\n// module chunks = 0"],"sourceRoot":""}
