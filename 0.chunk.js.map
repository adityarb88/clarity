This is sometimes called a master-detail\\n    or master-child pattern. On of the solutions we provide for this pattern is expandable rows in the datagrid.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    To make a row expandable, you need to put a <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-dg-row-detail&gt;</code>\\n    component inside your row, and add a <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">*clrIfExpanded</code> structural directive on it.\\n    This directive doesn't take any input, it is here for 2 reasons: make sure the details are only instantiated once\\n    they are needed, and make it very clear in <em>your</em> application templates that this part\\n    of the DOM is not present at all times, but only when the row is expanded.\\n    This component can contain anything: text, images, graphs, ... It can ignore the overall table layout.\\n    If you wish to display details for each cell of the row individually and respect the table layout,\\n    all you need to do is use our usual <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-dg-cell&gt;</code> component in the detail.\\n    Make sure you have exactly as many cells in the detail as you have in the row, or they will not align properly.\\n</p>\\n\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.basic\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"html\\\"></clr-example>\\n\\n<p>\\n    If you want the details to replace the original row rather than expand under it, we offer a\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">[clrDgReplace]</code> input that receives a boolean on the\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-dg-row-detail&gt;</code> component. In other words, to make details replace the row\\n    they're in, just write:\\n</p>\\n\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.replace\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"html\\\"></clr-example>\\n\\n<p>\\n    Finally, you might need to make a server call to get the details for a row before you can display them.\\n    This is a very common lazy loading pattern. In this case, you need to add a\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">[clrLoading]</code> directive receiving a boolean <em>anywhere in the row</em>.\\n    Yes, it can be absolutely anywhere, as long as it's in or on the row itself.\\n    The easiest way to make the server call lazily is simply to create a component that will make the call on\\n    initialization (typically in the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">ngOnInit()</code> method), and to use that component\\n    inside the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">*clrIfExpanded</code> structural directive. Here is an example of what this\\n    solution typically looks like.\\n</p>\\n\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.lazyLoadingRow\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"html\\\"></clr-example>\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.lazyLoadingDetail\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"typescript\\\"></clr-example>\\n\\n<div class=\\\"alert alert-info\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"alert-item\\\">\\n        <span class=\\\"alert-text\\\">\\n            Note the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">ngProjectAs</code> attribute on our custom detail component.\\n            This is needed to make sure it is projected in the same place an actual\\n            <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-dg-row-detail&gt;</code> would be.\\n        </span>\\n    </div>\\n</div>\\n\\n<p>\\n    Here is an example showcasing all these different combinations in action:\\n</p>\\n\\n<form>\\n    <div class=\\\"form-group\\\">\\n        <label>Type of detail</label>\\n        <div class=\\\"radio-inline\\\">\\n            <input type=\\\"radio\\\" name=\\\"detail\\\" id=\\\"detail-default\\\" value=\\\"default\\\" [(ngModel)]=\\\"detail\\\">\\n            <label for=\\\"detail-default\\\">Overall</label>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\\\"radio-inline\\\">\\n            <input type=\\\"radio\\\" name=\\\"detail\\\" id=\\\"detail-columns\\\" value=\\\"columns\\\" [(ngModel)]=\\\"detail\\\">\\n            <label for=\\\"detail-columns\\\">Per column</label>\\n        </div>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\\\"form-group\\\">\\n        <div class=\\\"checkbox-inline\\\">\\n            <input type=\\\"checkbox\\\" name=\\\"replace\\\" id=\\\"replace\\\" [(ngModel)]=\\\"replace\\\">\\n            <label for=\\\"replace\\\">Replace row</label>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\\\"checkbox-inline\\\">\\n            <input type=\\\"checkbox\\\" name=\\\"slow-load\\\" id=\\\"slow-load\\\" [(ngModel)]=\\\"slowLoad\\\">\\n            <label for=\\\"slow-load\\\">Lazy loading</label>\\n        </div>\\n    </div>\\n</form>\\n\\n<clr-datagrid>\\n    <clr-dg-column>User ID</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'name'\\\">Name</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'creation'\\\">Creation date</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'pokemon.name'\\\">Pokemon</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'color'\\\">Favorite color</clr-dg-column>\\n\\n    <clr-dg-row *clrDgItems=\\\"let user of users\\\" [clrDgItem]=\\\"user\\\">\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.id}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.name}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.creation | date}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.pokemon.name}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>\\n            <span class=\\\"color-square\\\" [style.backgroundColor]=\\\"user.color\\\"></span>\\n        </clr-dg-cell>\\n\\n        <clr-dg-row-detail *clrIfExpanded [clrDgReplace]=\\\"replace\\\">\\n            <ng-template [clrFakeLoader]=\\\"slowLoad\\\" clrLoading>\\n                <ng-container *ngIf=\\\"detail === 'default'\\\">\\n                    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

When this is the case you can write your own filter, with fully\\n    custom template and controller, and both wrap it in and pass it to a\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-dg-filter&gt;</code> component in your column declaration.\\n    This can be done whether or not your column is declared as a\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrDgField</code>, and will always take precedence over it if it is.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The filter you provide to the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-dg-filter&gt;</code> component\\n    needs to implement the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">Filter</code> interface provided by Clarity:\\n</p>\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.filterInterface\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"typescript\\\"></clr-example>\\n\\n<p>\\n    There are several ways to pass your filter to the\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-dg-filter&gt;</code> component:\\n</p>\\n<ul>\\n    <li>\\n        The simplest, but less reusable way, is to simply inline your filter's template in the\\n        column and use the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">[clrDgFilter]</code> input to pass your filter\\n        instance:\\n        <clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.inlineFilterTS\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"typescript\\\"></clr-example>\\n        <clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.inlineFilterHTML\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"html\\\"></clr-example>\\n    </li>\\n    <li>\\n        A more reusable way is to write an actual component for your custom filter,\\n        and inject its <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">DatagridFilter</code> parent in its constructor so\\n        that it can register itself:\\n        <clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.customFilterComponentTS\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"typescript\\\"></clr-example>\\n        <clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.customFilterComponentHTML\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"html\\\"></clr-example>\\n    </li>\\n    <li>\\n        Finally, if you want to have a completely reusable filter independently of our Datagrid,\\n        you can write a component for it and use a template reference variable to declare the\\n        filter to its container:\\n        <clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.templateVariableTS\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"typescript\\\"></clr-example>\\n        <clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.templateVariableHTML\\\"

This is a\\n    very common case that we fully support.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    We expose events and hooks on all parts of the datagrid to make sure you can trigger any\\n    requests you need based on precise user actions. But an important thing to note is that when\\n    the server does handle pagination, it needs to also deal with sorting and filtering,\\n    because all three are tightly coupled. In light of this, we decided to expose a single global\\n    output <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">(clrDgRefresh)</code> that emits the current \\\"state\\\" of the\\n    datagrid whenever it changes due to a user action or an external one. This state has the\\n    following format:\\n</p>\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.stateInterface\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"typescript\\\"></clr-example>\\n<p>\\n    It contains all the information you need to send to the server in order to get the slice of\\n    data currently displayed. It even contains redundant information (\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">page.to</code> and <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">page.size</code> for instance),\\n    to make sure you have access to the most practical for you without extra processing.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    One important thing to note is that since you don't have all the data available at once, you\\n    cannot use the smart iterator\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">*clrDgItems</code>: it would sort, filter and paginate a subset of the\\n    data that has already gone through all that.

Sometimes, a column is not even a property on your\\n    model but is dynamically generated instead. In these cases, you might want to specify a custom comparator to sort the\\n    column according to your needs. This can be done by providing a comparator through the\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">[clrDgSortBy]</code> input, whether or not your column is declared as a\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrDgField</code>, and will always take precedence over it if it is.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    A comparator is just an object that implements a <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">compare</code> method that could be given as\\n    parameter to Javascript's native\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">Array.sort()</code> function. In other words, if a and b are two elements being compared, then:\\n</p>\\n<ul>\\n    <li>\\n        if compare(a, b) is less than 0, a comes first,\\n    </li>\\n    <li>\\n        if compare(a, b) returns 0, leave a and b unchanged with respect to each other, but sorted with respect to all other items,\\n    </li>\\n    <li>\\n        if compare(a, b) is greater than 0, b comes first.\\n    </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>\\n    The safest way to check that your types comply with our API is to have your comparator be an instance of a class that implement\\n    the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">Comparator</code> interface provided by Clarity.\\n</p>\\n<div class=\\\"alert alert-info\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"alert-item\\\">\\n        <span class=\\\"alert-text\\\">\\n            Why use an object instead of the function directly?\\n        </span>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\\\"alert-item\\\">\\n        <span>\\n            Using an object implementing an interface allows strong type-checking, which is safer\\n            for your application.

These alerts are for notifying users that a particular component or area of the screen needs attention. Standard alerts have four levels, denoted by color and icon. From most to least severe, they are:</p>\\n\\n    <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>Error–a problem needs fixing</li>\\n        <li>Warning–an action might have a harmful outcome</li>\\n        <li>Info–a situation needs attention, at some point</li>\\n        <li>Success–a significant achievement occurred</li>\\n    </ul>\\n\\n    <p>Other choices for displaying messages are <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/input-fields\\\">input field validations</a> and <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/modals\\\">modals</a> . However, these components require users to take action before proceeding.</p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"placement-and-size\\\">Placement and Size</h3>\\n\\n    <p>Alert positioning should be contextual to the component or area to which it applies. For example, if the alert applies to the entire content area, place it at the top and span the width of that area.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Base the height of the alert (36 or 24 pixels) on its location. The larger alert is for use in the application’s main content area, modals, and wizards. The smaller alert is for use in cards.</p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"closing-alerts\\\">Closing Alerts</h3>\\n\\n    <p>A close button (X) serves as a method for users to acknowledge the alert. It also allows users to declutter the view. Omit the close button if the alert should be persistent.</p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"message-text\\\">Message Text</h3>\\n\\n    <p>Keep the message text short and concise. If combining multiple messages in a single alert, make sure that the messages are of the same type. Avoid mixing error and warning messages.</p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"stacking-alerts\\\">Stacking Alerts</h3>\\n\\n    <p>When showing multiple alerts, stack from most severe to least severe:</p>\\n\\n    <ol class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>Error</li>\\n        <li>Warning</li>\\n        <li>Info</li>\\n        <li>Success</li>\\n    </ol>\\n\\n    <p>Stack up to three alerts. For more than three, consider an alternate pattern, such as displaying the information on another page.</p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"actions\\\">Actions</h3>\\n\\n    <p>You can display up to two actions in an alert. For more than two actions, use a dropdown menu, limiting the number of items to five.</p>\\n\\n    <p>The most common course of action goes at the top of the menu, destructive actions at the bottom. Avoid placing destructive actions directly in the alert.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Actions in standard alerts are represented by links because links take up less space than buttons and are light in appearance.\\n        <!-- One line is 36 pixels tall using links.  With flat buttons, the line is taller to accommodate the button state change. -->\\n    </p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"color\\\">Color</h3>\\n\\n    <p>Alerts have their own color palette of red, yellow, green, and blue. They are not styled with Stoplight colors to avoid competition with call-to-action buttons.</p>\\n\\n    <h2 id=\\\"using-app-level-alerts\\\">Using App-Level Alerts</h2>\\n\\n    <p>An app-level alert appears at the top of the screen, above the application header. This alert is reserved for a single, system-level message.</p>\\n\\n    <p>App-level alerts have three severity levels:</p>\\n\\n    <table class=\\\"table .table-noborder \\\">\\n        <tr>\\n            <th class=\\\"left\\\">Type</th>\\n            <th class=\\\"left\\\">Example</th>\\n        </tr>\\n        <tr>\\n            <td class=\\\"left\\\">Error</td>\\n            <td class=\\\"left\\\">A problem exists with a server</td>\\n        </tr>\\n        <tr>\\n            <td class=\\\"left\\\">Warning</td>\\n            <td class=\\\"left\\\">A license is about to expire</td>\\n        </tr>\\n        <tr>\\n            <td valign=\\\"top\\\" class=\\\"left\\\">Info</td>\\n            <td class=\\\"left\\\"> A trial is about to end<br /> Support is required for a feature </td>\\n        </tr>\\n    </table>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"guidelines\\\">Guidelines</h3>\\n\\n    <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>Show only one app-level alert at a time.</li>\\n        <li>Keep the message text to one line–don’t wrap the text.</li>\\n        <li>Include up to two actions and keep button labels concise.</li>\\n        <li>Do not include a menu within the alert.</li>\\n        <li>When appropriate, include a close icon so that the app-level alert can be dismissed.</li>\\n    </ul>\\n</article>\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/pages/documentation/alerts.html\n// module id = 925\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"<article>\\n    <h5 class=\\\"component-summary\\\" id=\\\"a-properly-structured-layout-enforces-an-optimal-consistent-experience-across-applications\\\">A properly structured layout enforces an optimal, consistent experience across applications.</h5>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"layout\\\">Layout</h3>\\n\\n    <p><strong>.main-container:</strong></p>\\n    <div>\\n        The <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.main-container</code> is a vertical flexbox which wraps the following components:\\n        <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n            <li><a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/alerts\\\">App-Level Alert</a></li>\\n            <li><a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/header\\\">Header</a></li>\\n            <li><a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/header\\\">Subnav</a></li>\\n            <li>Content Container</li>\\n        </ul>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Although Clarity does not have a footer component, a custom footer can be added in the main-container.</p>\\n\\n    <p><strong>.content-container:</strong></p>\\n    <div>\\n        The <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.content-container</code> is a horizontal flexbox which wraps the following components:\\n        <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n            <li>Content Area</li>\\n            <li><a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/sidenav\\\">Sidenav</a></li>\\n        </ul>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <clr-layout-all-demo></clr-layout-all-demo>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"guidelines\\\">Basic Structure</h3>\\n\\n    <p>Two constants of an app built in Clarity are the header and content area.

Often, these actions navigate to a new location. For example, you might have a Settings dropdown that changes context to provide\\n        logout, account settings, and so on.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Don’t confuse dropdowns with <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/select-boxes\\\">select boxes</a>, which also present a list of choices. Select boxes are for data input within forms whereas dropdowns are for navigating outside of the existing context.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"behavior\\\">Behavior</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Users open a dropdown by clicking its toggle. By default, selecting a menu item or clicking outside the menu dismisses the menu. You can change this behavior so that the menu remains open on item selection.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"placement\\\">Placement</h4>\\n\\n    <p>By default, a dropdown opens from the bottom of the toggle, along the left side. You can change the placement by using one of the eight direction classes.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"menu-toggle\\\">Menu Toggle</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Clarity recommends that you use a button for the toggle. The button can contain either text or an icon.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"menu-items\\\">Menu Items</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Order menu items by usage, except for destructive actions, which belong at the bottom. Keep the text short and concise. Long menu items are truncated from the end and an ellipsis added.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"disabled\\\">Disabled</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Disable a menu item if:</p>\\n\\n    <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>It can apply in a different context.</li>\\n        <li>The user doesn’t have permissions for the action.</li>\\n        <li>An appropriate object is not currently selected.</li>\\n    </ul>\\n</article>\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/pages/documentation/dropdowns.html\n// module id = 935\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"<article>\\n    <h5 class=\\\"component-summary\\\" id=\\\"a-form-is-a-structured-layout-of-related-input-components\\\">A form is a structured layout of related input components.</h5>\\n\\n    <p>A container, often a <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">div</code> with a <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.form-group</code> classname on it, wraps one or more <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">label</code> and <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">input</code> pairs.</p>\\n\\n    <h6 id=\\\"form-block\\\">.form-block</h6>\\n\\n    <p class=\\\"squish\\\">This is an optional wrapper around one or more .form-group elements (see below).

Some pages might benefit from a three-column layout, where other pages might work best with a two-column layout.</p>\\n\\n    <p>You can vary the column layout within the same page. This strategy works well for presenting content that scrolls vertically.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Don’t lock your design into a layout optimized for a large window.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"grids-and-card-layouts\\\">Grids and Card Layouts</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Designing to a grid is especially important for <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/cards\\\">card</a> layouts. Cards contains blocks of content and their height and width can vary. The grid aligns the cards in a way that is easy for users to navigate.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"if-you-decide-not-to-conform-to-the-grid\\\">If You Decide Not to Conform to the Grid</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Do so with intent. Find a balance between aesthetics and conformity. Keep in mind that elements that are not aligned to the grid draw attention in the same way as color, contrast, and iconography and require more cognitive effort on the part of the\\n        user.</p>\\n</article>\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/pages/documentation/grid.html\n// module id = 937\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"<article class=\\\"header-dox\\\">\\n\\n    <h5 class=\\\"component-summary no-left-padding\\\" id=\\\"buttons-header\\\">\\n        Headers provide branding, navigation, search, and access to global\\n        application actions such as settings and notifications.\\n    </h5>\\n    <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\n        <div class=\\\"col-xs-12 col-no-padding\\\">\\n            <div class=\\\"clrweb-DocMedia-block\\\">\\n                <div class=\\\"header-demo\\\">\\n                    <header class=\\\"header-6\\\">\\n                        <div class=\\\"branding\\\">\\n                            <a class=\\\"logo-and-title\\\">\\n                                <clr-icon shape=\\\"file\\\"></clr-icon>\\n                                <span class=\\\"title\\\">Note App</span>\\n                            </a>\\n                        </div>\\n                        <div class=\\\"header-nav\\\">\\n                            <a href=\\\"javascript://\\\" class=\\\"nav-link\\\">\\n                                <span class=\\\"nav-text\\\">Notes</span>\\n                            </a>\\n                            <a href=\\\"javascript://\\\" class=\\\"active nav-link\\\">\\n                                <span class=\\\"nav-text\\\">Shared Notes</span>\\n                            </a>\\n                        </div>\\n                        <div class=\\\"header-actions\\\">\\n                            <div class=\\\"dropdown\\\">\\n                                <button class=\\\"nav-icon dropdown-toggle\\\">\\n                                    <clr-icon shape=\\\"cog\\\"></clr-icon>\\n                                    <clr-icon shape=\\\"caret down\\\"></clr-icon>\\n                                </button>\\n                                <div class=\\\"dropdown-menu\\\">\\n                                    <a href=\\\"javascript://\\\">About</a>\\n                                    <a href=\\\"javascript://\\\">Preferences</a>\\n                                    <a href=\\\"javascript://\\\">Log out</a>\\n                                </div>\\n                            </div>\\n                        </div>\\n                    </header>\\n                </div>\\n            </div>\\n        </div>\\n    </div>\\n    <h3>Style</h3>\\n    <p>The header is consistent across all pages of an application.

For easier access to the individual graphic parts of the icon, each piece of the glyph has a unique number identifier. For example,\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.clr-i-outline-path-3</code> targets the third path in the outlined version of an icon.\\n    </p>\\n\\n    <p>\\n        There are also a couple of common CSS classes that can help you target common elements.\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.clr-i-badge</code> targets the round dot in badged icons. Likewise, <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.clr-i-alert</code> targets the yellow triangle in alerted icons.

Placeholder text disappears when the user types in the field.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Tip: Use the label to show what information goes in the field and placeholder text as a hint, description, or example format:</p>\\n\\n    <p>Label: Airport\\n        <br /> Placeholder text: SFO, SJO</p>\\n\\n    <p>Placeholder text can replace labels only in simple forms with a few easily-understood fields, see the <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/login\\\">login page</a>.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Placeholder text is not required for every input field.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"size\\\">Size</h4>\\n\\n    <p>For the best user experience, consider localization and keep in mind that word length varies among languages.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"multiple-input-fields\\\">Multiple Input Fields</h4>\\n\\n    <p>A complex form might have multiple input fields, stacked vertically. Space the input fields evenly, clearly associating labels with the corresponding input fields.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"validation\\\">Validation</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Avoid overlaying the validation tooltip on the data is being validated. By default, the position of the tooltip is to the top-right of the error icon, pointing to its center. Other positions to consider are:</p>\\n\\n    <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>Top left</li>\\n        <li>Bottom right</li>\\n        <li>Bottom left</li>\\n        <li>Side left</li>\\n        <li>Side right</li>\\n    </ul>\\n\\n    <p>Base the width of the tooltip on the message text. Choices are 72 px, 120 px, 240 px, and 360 px. The default is 240 px.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Make the message text short, but informative. For example, “The username already exists. Enter a new name.” Try to limit the text to one line.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"multiline-text-area\\\">Multiline Text Area</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Use a multiline text area when a user must enter a long string. Content wraps when the cursor reaches the right edge and scrolls when it reaches the lower edge.</p>\\n</article>\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/pages/documentation/input-fields.html\n// module id = 940\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"<article>\\n\\n    <h5 class=\\\"component-summary\\\" id=\\\"labels-header\\\">Labels show concise metadata in a compact format.</h5>\\n\\n    <div class=\\\"clr-demo-container\\\">\\n        <div class=\\\"clr-demo-container__content\\\">\\n            <span class=\\\"label label-blue\\\">john@example.com</span>\\n            <span class=\\\"label label-blue\\\">james@example.com</span>\\n        </div>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <h3>Style</h3>\\n    <p>Labels are visually styled to differentiate them from buttons.</p>\\n    <div class=\\\"row\\\">\\n        <div class=\\\"col-xs-12 col-md-5\\\">\\n            <h4>Overall Style</h4>\\n            <p>\\n                The distinctive visual style of labels deliberately deviates from buttons.

It does not animate and lend itself to these sorts of DOM refreshes.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Because there was no way to turn off the animation in IE/Edge’s implementation of the HTML5 progress element, there is a related, though separate, component for static progress bars.</p>\\n\\n    <clr-progress-bar-static-demo class=\\\"clrweb-progress-demo\\\"></clr-progress-bar-static-demo>\\n\\n    <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>Instead of a <code>.progress</code> container <code>div</code>, the static progress bar has a <code>.progress-static</code> container <code>div</code>.</li>\\n        <li>Instead of a <code>progress</code> element inside the container, there is a <code>div&lt;/codeAtom&gt; with the class of <code>.progress-meter</code> applied to it.</code>\\n        </li>\\n        <li>A <code>div</code> cannot have a value attribute, so the <code>.progress-meter</code> element has <code>data-value</code> attribute.

The component exposes two methods (<code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">skipTab</code> and\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">unSkipTab</code>) to skip or un-skip a step. In order to use the methods, you will have to specify a unique id as an input (\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardStepId</code>) and pass that value into the methods. You can also set the input <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardStepIsSkipped</code> and the corresponding <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardPageIsSkipped</code> to\\n        skip the step and the matching page as shown in the example below.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"overriding-the-title-in-the-wizard-page\\\">Overriding the Title in the Wizard Page</h4>\\n\\n    <p>By default, the page on the right-hand side will display the same title as the text that is inside the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-wizard-step&gt;</code>. You may wish to override this for the matching page. You can do this by including an element\\n        inside the\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-wizard-page-deprecated&gt;</code> with class <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.wizard-page-title</code> as shown in the example below.</p>\\n\\n    <clr-wizard-deprecated-simple></clr-wizard-deprecated-simple>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"wizard-with-form-validation\\\">Wizard with Form Validation</h3>\\n\\n    <p>You can use form validation with the wizard.

The\\n        way to do this is to call the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">setCurrentPage()</code> method on\\n        the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">WizardNavigationService</code> provider of the wizard.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        The safest way to ensure that end-users do not wind up in a bad state is to make sure\\n        that the page to which they are navigating is completed and, if not, send users to the\\n        last valid page using the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">setLastEnabledPageCurrent()</code>\\n        method on the same <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">WizardNavigationService</code>\\n        provider, as in the example below.\\n    </p>\\n\\n    <clr-wizard-jump-to></clr-wizard-jump-to>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"overriding-the-title-in-the-wizard-page\\\">Different Page Title in the Sidenav</h3>\\n\\n    <p>\\n        By default, the nav item on the right-hand side will display the same title as the title \\n        inside the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;ng-template clrPageTitle&gt;</code> in your\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-wizard-page&gt;</code>. In fact, this is the <em>only</em>\\n        element that is required inside your <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-wizard-page&gt;</code>.\\n        It provides not only the title at the top of the content area but also the item in the \\n        sidenav to the left.\\n    </p>\\n\\n    <p>\\n        Sometimes, however, having the title in the content area match the nav item is not a\\n        desired behavior. The title in the content area may be too long or the nav item may\\n        need to update based on changes elsewhere in the wizard.\\n    </p>\\n\\n    <p>\\n        To accomplish this customization, you can use a <code\\n        class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;ng-template clrPageNavTitle&gt;</code> element. When placed inside,\\n        a <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-wizard-page&gt;</code>, a <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrPageNavTitle</code>\\n        template reference will be used in the nav sidebar of the wizard instead of the content title.\\n    </p>\\n\\n    <p>\\n        As with any Angular content, you can also use projection to change the titles in either a\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrPageTitle</code> or <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrPageNavTitle</code>\\n        whenever you need to.\\n    </p>\\n\\n    <clr-wizard-titles></clr-wizard-titles>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"custom-page-buttons\\\">Overriding buttons at the page level</h3>\\n\\n    <p>\\n        As part of creating a wizard, you need to include a set of default buttons of types finish,\\n        next, previous, and cancel as a direct child of your <code\\n        class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-wizard&gt;</code> element.\\n    </p>\\n\\n    <clr-wizard-default-buttons></clr-wizard-default-buttons>\\n\\n    <p>\\n        These buttons can be overridden at the page level, however, with other buttons of the same\\n        type (but with different text) or with completely custom buttons. To override the default\\n        buttons, include a new set of buttons inside a <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;ng-template clrPageButtons&gt;</code>\\n        template reference element. Sets of buttons defined at the page level will override the\\n        default buttons defined at the wizard level.\\n    </p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"custom-buttons\\\">Custom buttons and page-level button overrides</h3>\\n\\n    <p>\\n        A <em>page override</em> is defining a button at the page level in place of a button of the same type at the\\n        wizard level. These types include finish, danger, next, previous, and cancel. If you override the\\n        click events of these buttons with an output like <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardPagePreventDefault</code>,\\n        you can also short-circuit the default action of the button to define your own custom action at the\\n        page level.\\n    </p>\\n\\n    <p>\\n        A <em>custom button</em> is a different beast entirely. Custom buttons are not like\\n        page overrides. They have no action assigned to them. So you will need to use the\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardPageCustomButton</code> output to assign an action to your custom\\n        buttons. The output receives the custom button type which should allow you to route your wizard's\\n        behavior based on the type of button it receives.\\n    </p>\\n\\n    <p>\\n        You can use specified custom button types such as <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">custom-finish</code>,\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">custom-next</code>,\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">custom-danger</code>,\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">custom-previous</code>, or\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">custom-cancel</code> to have your custom buttons inherit the styling\\n        of the button listed in the latter part of the button type. Note, however, that these\\n        custom buttons <em>do not</em> kick off the actions associated with their styled types.\\n        You have to tell a wizard what you want a button to do.\\n    </p>\\n\\n    <p>\\n        By default, a custom button will be styled as an outline button. Meaning it will look like a\\n        \\\"previous\\\" type of button. For example, you would get an action blue, outlined button with the\\n        text \\\"Wallaby\\\" inside it if you created a button with the following declaration:\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-wizard-button [type]=\\\"'wallaby'\\\"&gt;Wallaby&lt;/clr-wizard-button&gt;</code>.\\n        And if your page was listening to the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardPageCustomButton</code> output,\\n        your event handler would receive the button type <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">wallaby</code> as a parameter\\n        when the custom button was clicked.\\n    </p>\\n\\n    <p>\\n        Reference the following example:\\n    </p>\\n\\n    <clr-wizard-custom-buttons></clr-wizard-custom-buttons>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"wizard-with-form-validation\\\">Wizard with Form Validation</h3>\\n\\n    <p>\\n        You can use form validation with the wizard.

If you need to reset\\n        the wizard while it is open, destroying and recreating it would be a poor experience\\n        for users. Likewise, some applications are architected such that it is less expensive\\n        to reuse an instance of a wizard instead of destroying it and making the backend\\n        calls necessary to re-initialize a new instance.\\n    </p>\\n\\n    <p>\\n        The Clarity wizard includes a <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">reset()</code> convenience method.\\n        In order to use it, you would need a reference to the wizard in your host component and\\n        can call reset from there. In the example below, we use <code\\n        class=\\\"clr-code\\\">wizard.reset()</code> which references the ViewChild\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-wizard #wizard&gt;</code> in the host component's template.\\n    </p>\\n\\n    <p>\\n        The <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">reset()</code> method resets the wizard's\\n        navigation and page state. So it clears out any pages that were\\n        marked completed and sets the active page back to the first page of the wizard.\\n    </p>\\n\\n    <p>\\n        When resetting the wizard, it is your responsibility to reset your wizard's\\n        model. This can be done either as part of the action that calls the reset, as in\\n        the example below, or with an event handler that listens to the\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardOnReset</code> output.\\n    </p>\\n\\n    <clr-wizard-reset></clr-wizard-reset>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"alternative-cancel\\\">Providing an alternative cancel for the wizard</h3>\\n\\n    <p>\\n        The Clarity wizard allows users to circumvent the default cancel/close action at\\n        both the page and wizard level to enable their own functionality to validate,\\n        prompt users, or reset their data.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        At the wizard level, setting the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardPreventDefaultCancel</code>\\n        input to true prevents the wizard’s cancel routine from running on any page. When the\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardPreventDefaultCancel</code> input is set, users must\\n        also assign an event handler to the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardOnCancel</code>\\n        output and manually call <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">close()</code> on their instance of\\n        the wizard for the cancel action to take effect.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        That cancel/close functionality of the wizard can also be overridden at the page\\n        level. Users must set the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardPagePreventDefaultCancel</code>\\n        input to true on the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-wizard-page&gt;</code> declaration\\n        and likewise supply an event handler to the\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardPageOnCancel</code> output. This event handler will\\n        also need to manually call <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">close()</code> for the expected\\n        wizard cancel functionality to take effect.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        In the case of a conflict where the cancel action is overridden at both the page and\\n        wizard levels, the page level takes precedence.\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardOnCancel</code> will never be emitted.

It cannot circumvent making a page current but it\\n            will notify you when a page has been made current and it delivers the\\n            page’s id as a string.\\n        </li>\\n        <li>\\n            <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardPageOnCancel</code> is an output that fires\\n            when a user's action on a page initiates the wizard’s cancel routine. This\\n            output, combined with the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardPagePreventDefaultCancel</code>\\n            or <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardPagePreventDefault</code> inputs, allows you\\n            to customize or rewrite the cancellation of a wizard from a page level.\\n        </li>\\n        <li>\\n            Wizard pages also have a set of outputs that emit when different buttons\\n            are clicked in the wizard. Note that these events are only emitted for the\\n            page when the page is current. These outputs include:\\n            <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardPageFinish</code> when the finish button is\\n            clicked, <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardPagePrevious</code> when the previous button\\n            is clicked, <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardPageNext</code> when the next button\\n            is clicked, <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardPageDanger</code> when a danger button\\n            is clicked, <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardPagePrimary</code> when a\\n            next/finish/danger button is clicked, and\\n            <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardPageCustomButton</code> when any custom button\\n            is clicked. All of these outputs (and <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardPageOnCancel</code>)\\n            can be combined with the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardPagePreventDefault</code>\\n            input to create a unique, page-based behavior.

The two that you are most likely to interact\\n        with are the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">WizardNavigationService</code> and\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">PageCollectionService</code>.\\n    </p>\\n\\n    <h6>WizardNavigationService</h6>\\n\\n    <p>\\n        The <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">WizardNavigationService</code> or “nav service” is the wizard’s\\n        executive assistant. It communicates with the wizard, the pages, and the\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">PageCollectionService</code> to make sure everyone stays in sync.\\n        Most of what the nav service does is already available to you through convenience methods\\n        on the wizard. Methods like <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">next()</code>,\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">previous()</code>, and <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">finish()</code>.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        It may have seemed, initially, that the wizard was super-helpful and doing lots of work.\\n        But the truth is the nav service does all the work. The wizard just gets all the credit!\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        Because much of what the nav service does is behind-the-scenes, there is really only\\n        one method on the nav service that may interest you:\\n    </p>\\n\\n    <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>\\n            <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">wizard.navService.goTo()</code> takes either the id of a page\\n            or the page object itself and checks to see if it can make the page current. This is\\n            slightly more flexible than <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">wizard.goTo()</code> which only\\n            takes a page id.\\n        </li>\\n    </ul>\\n\\n    <h6>PageCollectionService</h6>\\n\\n    <p>\\n        The <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">PageCollectionService</code> &mdash; or “page collection” &mdash;\\n        groups all of the pages in the wizard together and acts as kind of a librarian. If you\\n        are looking for a page or even a group of pages, the page collection has you covered.\\n        The page collection also handles a small set of bulk actions on the pages in a wizard.\\n    </p>\\n\\n    <p><b>Properties</b></p>\\n\\n    <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>\\n            <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">wizard.pageCollection.pages</code> is a\\n            <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">QueryList</code> of all the pages in a wizard.\\n        </li>\\n        <li>\\n            <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">wizard.pageCollection.pagesAsArray</code> is\\n            a convenient getter that returns\\n            <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">wizard.pageCollection.pages</code> as an array of page objects.\\n        </li>\\n    </ul>\\n\\n    <p><b>Methods</b></p>\\n    <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>\\n            If you know a page’s id, you can pass it as a string parameter to\\n            <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">wizard.pageCollection.getPageById()</code> and it will\\n            return the page if it exists in the page collection.\\n        </li>\\n        <li>\\n            Alternatively, you can pass the page’s index in the list of pages as a number\\n            parameter to <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">wizard.pageCollection.getPageByIndex()</code>\\n            to get the page returned back to you.\\n        </li>\\n        <li>\\n            If you have a page and you need to know where it is in the list of pages, you\\n            can pass the page object as a parameter to\\n            <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">wizard.pageCollection.getPageIndex()</code>\\n            and it will return the page’s numeric index.\\n        </li>\\n        <li>\\n            Passing a page object to <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">wizard.pageCollection.getPreviousPage()</code>\\n            as a parameter will return you the page before it in the collection or null\\n            if your page object is the first page in the collection.\\n        </li>\\n        <li>\\n            Continuing the trend, you can pass a page object as a parameter to\\n            <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">wizard.pageCollection.getNextPage()</code> and it will\\n            return the page after your page object in the collection or null if your\\n            page object is the last page in the collection.\\n        </li>\\n        <li>\\n            <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">wizard.pageCollection.updateCompletedStates()</code>\\n            is a function that cleans up the page collection by figuring out the first page\\n            marked as incomplete and the collection and then marking every page after\\n            it incomplete as well.

A wizard simplifies the workflow by directing users serially through the tasks.</p>\\n\\n    <p>If the user doesn’t need to complete the workflow in a predefined order, use a <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/modals\\\">modal</a> instead.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"base-wizard-size-on-use-case\\\">Base Wizard size on use case</h4>\\n\\n    <p>BSizes are 576 px, 864 px and 1056 px (default).
